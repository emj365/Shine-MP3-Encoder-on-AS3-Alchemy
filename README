To use the swc file in your flex application, include the swc file while
compiling the application.

"mxmlc my_app.mxml -library-path+=/path/to/shineMP3_alchemy.swc"

I have included only the option to include the swc file. There will/might be
other options that you have to pass to mxmlc.

If you want to delve into the code and do something more:
========================================================
* You have to get the source code by forking or any other means.
* You'll have to download the alchemy toolkit from http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/alchemy.html
* Follow the instructions to install alchemy on your machine.
* If you have modified the source code in lib/shine, run "make" in lib/shine
  directory to generate the /lib/shine/shine.swc file. Then run the build_as3.sh
  in the project root folder to generate the bin/shineMP3_alchemy.swc
* If you have modified the actionscript source in 
  src/fr/kikko/lab/ShineMP3Encoder.as, run the build_as3.sh in the project 
  root folder to generate the bin/shineMP3_alchemy.swc

NOTES:
=======================================================
I'm not a legal expert by any stretch of imagination. You are using this code
at your own risk. Why is that and why did law come into the equation here?

* MP3 is not a free codec. http://mp3licensing.com/royalty/
* And this is an LGPL'ed code. If you link the library statically into your
application, that too will be come under LGPL or GPL(not sure which one, as i
said earlier, I am not a lawyer).

So, if you use this code and become the next big thing like Google or Facebook,
and you have lawyers knocking on your door, don't blame me; I have warned you.
